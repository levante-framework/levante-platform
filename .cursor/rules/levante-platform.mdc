### General Project Context
* levante-platform is a monorepo built with turborepo that integrates firebase-functions (backend) and levante-dashboard (vue + vite dashboard UI) into a single repository.

## How to setup local dev environment:

### Install dependencies and build projects:

`npm install`

`npm run build`

### Run the development server:

`npm run dev`

### Seed Firebase Emulator data:

Keep the server running, and in another terminal window, run:

`npm run emulator:seed`

## Dashboard Repository

- Levante Dashboard https://github.com/levante-framework/levante-dashboard

## Firebase Functions Repository

- Firebase Functions https://github.com/levante-framework/levante-firebase-functions

### Coding Style & Best Practices

* Follow the linting rules defined in [@.eslintrc.js/.json] and formatting rules in [@.prettierrc.js/.json] if they exist.
* Validate incoming data for HTTPS functions rigorously.
* Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
* Handle asynchronous operations correctly using `async/await`.
